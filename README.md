Speech recognition is one of the important areas in digital speech processing. Hidden Markov Model or HMM proved to be bery good method to do speech recognition. This code implements the HMM algorithm to detect user voice and the words he says.

This code is implemented in MATLAB to use voice recognition as access control or voice password with simple training code that need to be done only once for every new user and another code that gives access only to the user the model trained to.
